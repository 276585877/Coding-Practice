//492. Construct The Rectangle
//
// For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:
//
// 1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
//
// 2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
//
// 3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
//
// You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

        vector<int> ans;
        int L, W;
        for(int i = 1; i <= sqrt(area); ++i){
          if(area%i == 0){
            L = area/i;
            W = i;
          }
        }
