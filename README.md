# :rocket: Coding Practice

This github repository collects my C++ solutions for algorithm problems from LeetCode Online Judge, Lintcode Online Judge, and Hackerrank. Practice makes perfect. :octocat:

I also will continue adding more inforamtion about baisc knowledge of Linux popualr shell commands, database internal knowledge, etc.

I hope this repository can help us to persistantly sharpen basic coding skills, and meanwhile I truely hope that it can help anyone who needs any inspiration about coding interview.

You are welcome to clone this repo to your local as a reference. If you get better solutions, you are welcomed to share with me. And don't forget to star. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:


BTW, welcome to visit my new blog HappyIsotope: http://www.happyisotope.com and my personal portfolio page:www.zhuojia7.com .
