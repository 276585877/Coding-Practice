<h1>Coding Practice<br></h1>

This github repository contains clean C++ & Java solutions for algorithm problems from LeetCode Online Judge, Lintcode Online Judge, and Hackerrank. My free suggestion: hen we think about the solution, try to make yourself happy. 

Also, inspired by "Talk is cheap. Show me the code", I believe that implementing these theoretical algorithms is an essential step to be a serious coder. Therefore, I may share some basic algorithm implementations, as implementing these theoretical algorithms is an essential step to be a serious coder.  I am a starter, but I am willing to make effort to be better.

I hope this repository can help me to persistantly sharpen basic coding skills, and meanwhile I trully hope that it can help everyone who needs any inspiration about coding interview.  

If you get better solutions, you are welcomed to fork and contribute this repository. 

BTW, welcome to visit my blog HappyIsotope: http://happyisotope.coding.io/.
